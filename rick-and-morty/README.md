## This is Mark's Rick & Morty app :)

## Let's get going

First, to run the development server you need to install all deps that are required in the build

```bash
npm install
```

Then once it has done it's magic you can run the below:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see something amazing.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. If you dare :)

## Testing

I have included my version of testing in here with Jest, If I had more time I would do some integration tests with it.
